# Test function (WIP)

This is the editable WIP version of `TestFunction.lean`. It defines the
real-valued piecewise test function `g_S` and proves the elementary facts about
it.

Target statements:

* endpoint values and range bounds;
* evenness;
* a.e. derivative formulas on the core, transition, and tail regions;
* denominator positivity;
* concrete energy/deficit definitions for the constructed family;
* layer energy identity (task #9);
* variance computation (task #10).

The upstream API (normalization constants, potential, region boundaries) is
imported from `L2Counterexample.Normalization` / `L2Counterexample.Potential`.
Because those modules are currently empty stubs, the data we consume from them
is declared here as local `axiom`s with signatures matching the blueprint.
Once the upstream modules are populated, these axioms should be replaced by
`theorem` statements that `exact?` from the real definitions.

`phi_S, phiDer_S, phiDer2_S, eps_S, eta_S` come from `Potential.lean`.

the layer normalizer `A_S`, the probability measure `rho_S`, and the
asymptotic axioms specific to the test function — are recorded here. -/

absolute value, which lies in upstream measure-theoretic infrastructure. -/

Justification (informal): on `layerPos S`, `g_S y = N_S S y / A_S` because
`y > 0` so `|y| = y`. By FTC for the interval-integral
defining `N_S`, the derivative of `N_S` at `y` is
`φ''_S(y) · exp(φ_S(y))`. -/

/-! ## Continuity of `g_S`

The function `g_S` is continuous on the whole real line.  The proof at the
core endpoints uses that `N_S(1-ε)/A_S = 0` and at the exterior endpoints
that `N_S(1+ε)/A_S = 1`. Continuity in the open regions follows from
each piece being continuous (constants, or the antiderivative of a
continuous function). The full local-piecewise glue via standard mathlib
lemmas is encapsulated by the following axiom; the elementary statement is
"piecewise functions agreeing at the boundaries of contiguous intervals are
continuous". -/
